## Course description
Programming skills and software tools for building automated bioinformatics pipelines and computational biology analyses. Emphasis on UNIX tools and R libraries for distilling raw sequencing data into interpretable results.  This course is aimed at students familiar with UNIX and with some programming experience in python, R, or C/C++.

## Meeting times and locations
### Classes: 

Monday and Wednesday, 9:00-10:20 am, Foege S110 (http://www.washington.edu/home/maps/southcentral.html?gnom).

### Class Slack: 
We will use Slack during class and outside of class to communicate, share code snippets, ask and answer questions. The class slack is here:
* [gs-bioinf-workflows.slack.com](https://gs-bioinf-workflows.slack.com)

You will receive an invitation to join prior to the first class.

### Office hours: 
* No official office hours. Post questions on Slack as needed.

## Prerequisites
* Substantial background in molecular and cellular biology, genetics, biochemistry, or related disciplines.
* Familiarity with UNIX.
* Some programming experience in python, R, or C/C++. 
* Students are encouraged to have taken GENOME559 and/or GENOME560.

## Course requirements
* The course involves hands-on programming during class time. We will use the GS compute cluster, so make sure you can log into it from your computer remotely.
* All programming projects are due by the start of class on the date listed.
* You are welcome to talk to classmates about principles for solving problems, but please do not share code or program together. In many ways, writing your own code is where you will learn the most for this class.

## Examinations

There will be no examinations.

## Course grade
Grades will come 50% from the programming projects and 50% from class participation.
